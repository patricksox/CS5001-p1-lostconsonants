Functionality
- Able to find the alternatives for words but not all for the sentences.
- Sometimes removed digits as well incorrectly

Extensions
- No extensions attempted

Design & implementation
- Try to compare with more ands or use arrays instead of nested ifs
- Should try to ensure that only consonants are matched; check not vowel and between a-z
- Some functions very similar; could be combined but return an object instead with all the required information
- Functions could be decomposed more; each function to achieve only one small thing
- Read the Java 8 API more on the String manipulation methods to simplify some of your code
- Think and plan more for what your code should do and refactor your code to make it cleaner

Code quality
- Try to write more JavaDocs and comments for the methods
- Try to format your code better; note the style checker output of the autochecker

Autochecking
- You passed 21 out of 28 tests

Testing
- No evidence of additional testing

Report
- None included

Overall comments (Summary)
- A coding practical containing code achieving most of the required functionality and of acceptable standard.
